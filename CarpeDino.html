                Carpe Dino is an upcoming game set to release on Steam by
                September 2024. Originally conceived as a thesis project by two
                game design students, it has grown into a collaborative effort
                involving a team of 26, including 2D artists, sound designers,
                writers, marketers, producers, and four programmers, including
                myself. <br /><br />
                The game combines simulation and dating mechanics in a world
                where players can nurture relationships and explore
                dinosaur-filled landscapes. Beyond its gameplay, Carpe Dino
                marks the beginning of a new studio, Black Squirrels Studio,
                uniting four team members in their pursuit of future game
                development projects.
