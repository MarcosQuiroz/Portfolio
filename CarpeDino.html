              <p class="about-info">
                Carpe Dino is an upcoming game set to release on Steam by
                September 2024. Originally conceived as a thesis project by two
                game design students, it has grown into a collaborative effort
                involving a team of 26, including 2D artists, sound designers,
                writers, marketers, producers, and four programmers, including
                myself. <br /><br />
                The game combines simulation and dating mechanics in a world
                where players can nurture relationships and explore
                dinosaur-filled landscapes. Beyond its gameplay, Carpe Dino
                marks the beginning of a new studio, Black Squirrels Studio,
                uniting four team members in their pursuit of future game
                development projects.

                <p>
                  I created custom functions in the DialogueFunctionality script
                  to be used in any Yarn Spinner file, which significantly
                  impacts the game's dynamic interactions. These functions
                  enable seamless integration of dialogue actions with game
                  mechanics, enhancing the player's experience by making in-game
                  conversations more interactive and meaningful.
                  <br /><br />
                  The dialogue scripts are designed to handle all scenarios and
                  necessary changes during a dialogue. This comprehensive
                  handling ensures that the game reacts appropriately to various
                  dialogue outcomes, maintaining consistency and immersion. By
                  managing these transitions smoothly, the scripts contribute to
                  a more engaging and coherent storytelling experience.
                  <br /><br />
                  In addition to the main dialogues, I implemented a Barks
                  system for mini-games. Barks are short lines of dialogue
                  triggered during gameplay to provide feedback and enhance
                  player engagement. These spontaneous interactions add
                  personality and immediacy to the characters, making the
                  mini-games feel more dynamic and immersive.

                <p>
                  I developed an obstacle and enemy (Dangers) spawning system to
                  enhance the dynamic challenge in the game. This system
                  leverages a structured data-driven approach using the
                  DangerSpawnerData and IntervalsOfSpawningData structs. Each
                  DangerSpawnerData instance defines the type of danger, pool
                  size, initial delay, and intervals of spawning, allowing for
                  precise control over the spawning behavior throughout the
                  game.
                  <br /><br />
                  The DangerSpawnerManager script manages multiple danger
                  spawners, each capable of targeting either the player or a
                  partner character. This flexibility ensures that the gameplay
                  remains unpredictable and engaging. The spawner adjusts its
                  behavior based on the game's timer and specific intervals,
                  modifying spawn rates to maintain an appropriate difficulty
                  curve as the game progresses.
                  <br /><br />
                  To efficiently handle the dangers, I implemented a pooling
                  system through the DangerPool class. This system minimizes
                  performance overhead by reusing instantiated danger objects,
                  ensuring a smooth gaming experience even during intense
                  gameplay moments. By dynamically adjusting the spawning logic
                  and efficiently managing resources, this system significantly
                  contributes to the game's challenging and immersive
                  environment.

                  The PartnerController class is pivotal for managing NPC
                  partners, using Unity's NavMesh system for effective
                  navigation and intelligent behavior. It dynamically adjusts
                  paths to intercept or evade dangers, enhancing player
                  strategy. The PartnerCharacter parent class standardizes
                  essential functionalities like energy management and ability
                  animations across different partners, ensuring consistency. I
                  developed the Oska class to add unique abilities, such as a
                  timed key sequence challenge, which requires quick player
                  reactions, making gameplay more engaging and interactive.

                  The PlayersInput script is crucial for managing player and
                  partner controls during mini-games, using Unity's Input System
                  for smooth, responsive interactions. It allows player movement
                  via WASD keys and partner control with arrow keys, or
                  automatically if preferred. The script also handles special
                  abilities, partner shield toggling, and game pauses, adding
                  strategic depth. Additionally, it includes haptic feedback for
                  immersive, tactile responses, enhancing the overall gameplay
                  experience.
